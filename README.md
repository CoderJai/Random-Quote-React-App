#Random Quote App!

---

Hi! I'm Jai, this is my final project for my JavaScript App Development class at Tech Talent South in Charlotte. I used **React, CSS, Styled Components, CodeSandbox, and UI Gradients to create this app.**

This app is a basic random quote app that pulls a different quote from the API every time you click a button. I used UI Gradients to make the background and the buttons pretty, and made a card for the quote and button out of CSS. I fully intend to come back and try to create the card out of Styled Components some time in the near future.

_Come back later to see the future changes I will make to the project._
You can find my project on CodeSandbox.io [here](https://codesandbox.io/embed/morning-glade-thw82?autoresize=1&fontsize=14&theme=dark).
